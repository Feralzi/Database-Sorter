# Database-Sorter
A simple code to sort data and combine data however way you want. 

HOW TO USE - 
There are two files in the folder that you need to pay attention to. One of the files is 'database.txt', this is where you insert any amounts of data or words. The other file is 'Style.txt', this is optional, but this is where you insert any data in which you want to combine with 'database.txt' or alter 'database.txt'. Once you run it, the output will be printed into 'FINAL.txt'.
The code is designed to take in the data and create its own list in order to be sorted however way you want it.
