The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. Diamonds hit like pop rocks
The 20-meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. We got too hot
The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. Lighting blunts with lava
A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. We don’t do the drama but the Oscars where I’m posted at Grammys on my neck
Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. Shoot for the stars I swear to god on that
The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. Ima need you to stand on that
The test will begin on the word start. I’m tryna tap in with your almanac
On your mark, get ready, start.
